I'll pile on the candy
It's such a pretty sight
It makes the food taste a dandy
But my tummy hurts all night
I'll put in some ingredients
But keep the rest for me
I'm not just disobedient
I'm careful can't you see

It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake
If you're way is hazy
You gotta do the cooking by the book
You know you can't be lazy
Never use a messy recipe
Your cake may end up crazy
If you do the cooking by the book
Then you'll have a cake
We gotta have it made
You know that I love cake
Finally it's time to make a cake

Making food is just like science
With tools that blend and baste
And every fun appliance gives the food a different taste

It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake
If you're way is hazy
You gotta do the cooking by the book
You know you can't be lazy
Never use a messy recipe
Your cake may end up crazy
If you do the cooking by the book
Then you'll have a cake
We gotta have it made
You know that I love cake
Finally it's time to make a cake
We gotta have it made
You know that I love cake
Finally it's time to make a
You gotta do the cooking by the book
Cake!
