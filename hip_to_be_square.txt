I used to be a renegade
I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment
And had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight
And yes, I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy
But I don't even care
Because I can tell what's going on
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
I like my bands in business suits
I watch them on TV
I'm working out most every day
And watchin' what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me
But I don't even care
I know that it's crazy
I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square
It's not too hard to figure out
You see it every day
And those that were the farthest out
Have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway
It don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it
An idea whose time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy
Don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square
Tell 'em, boys
(Here, there, and everywhere)
(Hip, hip, so hip to be a square)
(Here, there, and everywhere)
(Hip, hip)
(Here, there, and everywhere)
(Hip, hip, so hip to be a square)
(Here, there, and everywhere)
(Hip, hip)
(Here, there, and everywhere)
(Hip, hip, so hip to be a square)
(Here, there, and everywhere)
(Hip, hip)
(Here, there, and everywhere)
(Hip, hip, so hip to be a square)
(Here, there, and everywhere)
So hip to be square
(Hip, hip)
(Here, there, and everywhere)
